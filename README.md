**Description**: A floating navigation bar that includes authentication functionality. It shows links for Home, Dashboard, and Create Form, and displays the userâ€™s avatar or a login button based on their authentication status.

   ```

2. **Integrate Navbar in Your Layout**:
   ```jsx
   import { Navbar } from './components/Navbar';

   const Layout = () => {
     return (
       <div>
         <Navbar />
         {/* Other layout components */}
       </div>
     );
   };
   ```

3. **Authentication**:
   - Wrap your app with the Clerk provider in `_app.js` or `_app.tsx` to manage authentication.

**Basic Example**:
```jsx
<Navbar />
```

For detailed instructions, refer to the [Navbar Documentation](./Navbar/README.md).

## Notes
- Each component is designed to be modular and reusable.
- We use `clsx` for conditional classnames and `prop-types` for prop validation.
- Components are built using **React** and can be easily integrated into any React application.
- Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (e.g., `react`, `react-dom`, `prop-types`, `clsx`).
- Ensure you import the required context providers (e.g., for `Alert Toast` and `Navbar`).
- Custom styles can be added via **Tailwind CSS** or **styled-components** as needed.

For detailed documentation on each component, refer to the respective README files in their folders.
